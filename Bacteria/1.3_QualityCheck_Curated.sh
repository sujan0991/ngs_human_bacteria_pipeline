#                   OVERVIEW
# ******************************************************************************
# I Preprocessing
# 1.1 Quality check of the raw data. FastQC and MultiQC
# 1.2 Data Curation
#        - excluding samples (optional)
#        - UMI extraction (optional; usually NOT needed for bacteria)
#        - cutting adapter sequences (optional)
#        - remove low quality reads (optional)
#        - removing poly-sequences (optional)
# 1.3 Quality check of the curated data

# II Alignment 
#       - DNA -> BWA
#       - RNA -> Eukaryotic -> STAR
#       - RNA -> Prokarytic -> BWA
# 2.1 Generating genome indexes files. (Needs to be done only once!) 
# 2.2 - 2.4 Alignment -> .sam files

# III Picard Processing
# 3.1 Sorting
# 3.2 Adding read group information
# 3.3 Marking duplicates and indexing

# IV Quality check of aligned bam files
# 4.1. If alignment was done with STAR, Log.final.out to look at sumary stats of mapping 
#       mapping rate. >=75% is a good quality sample
#       multimapping. If multimapping is high, there are usually two issues: a) sample was contaminated (-> check .fastq data quality) b) alignment did not work (-> check mapping options)

# 4.2. Qualimap
# https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon/lessons/03_QC_STAR_and_Qualimap_run.html#qualimap

# V Variant Calling
# 5.1 HaplotypeCaller - .makes g.vcf file per each sample
# 5.2 ConsolidateGVCFs - combine g.vcf files into a single file
# 5.3 Genotyping - makes single .vcf file with all variants
# 5.4 Select variants - splits variants into SNPs and indels
# 5.5 - 5.9 Filtering, sorting, and combining

# In this script: 1.3 QUALITY CONTROL of the CURATED DATA: generate FastQC and MultiQC reports
#         - run fastqc on all curated samples
#         - produce multiqc report for all curated samples
#         - fastqc and multiqc for all reverse and forward reads if data is paired-end

# threads --- number of cores/cpus the process will use. If not provided, the default value is 4.
